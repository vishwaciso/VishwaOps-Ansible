## üß† Core Terminologies

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Ansible** | An open-source IT automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. |
| **Controller Node / Control Machine** | The machine where Ansible is installed and from which all tasks are executed. |
| **Managed Node / Target Node** | The remote systems that Ansible manages and automates. |
| **Inventory** | A file (usually `hosts` file) that lists all managed nodes with their IPs, hostnames, and groups. |
| **Groups** | Logical collections of hosts within the inventory file (e.g., `[webservers]`, `[dbservers]`). |
| **Modules** | The building blocks of Ansible‚Äîsmall programs (like `copy`, `yum`, `apt`, `service`, etc.) that perform specific actions on nodes. |
| **Tasks** | Individual units of work (e.g., install a package, start a service) defined in a playbook. |
| **Play** | A mapping of a group of hosts to a set of tasks (one ‚Äúplay‚Äù = one scenario of automation). |
| **Playbook** | A YAML file that contains one or more plays defining automation steps. |
| **Ad-hoc Commands** | One-line Ansible commands used for quick tasks (e.g., `ansible all -m ping`). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Files

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ansible.cfg** | Configuration file defining settings such as inventory location, privilege escalation, connection type, etc. |
| **Facts** | System information automatically gathered by Ansible (e.g., IP, OS type, CPU count). |
| **Gather Facts** | A step in a playbook that collects system information before running tasks. |
| **Handlers** | Special tasks triggered by other tasks (usually after a change), e.g., restart a service. |
| **Templates** | Files (usually `.j2` Jinja2 templates) where variables are dynamically replaced during deployment. |
| **Variables** | Custom values stored and used inside playbooks or templates to make them dynamic. |
| **Conditionals** | Statements that make task execution depend on conditions (e.g., `when: ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'`). |
| **Loops** | Repeat a task multiple times using items (e.g., `with_items` or `loop`). |

---

## üß∞ Advanced Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Roles** | A structured way to organize playbooks‚Äîincludes tasks, templates, files, handlers, and variables. |
| **Collections** | A distribution format for Ansible content (roles, plugins, modules) maintained by the community. |
| **Galaxy** | Ansible‚Äôs public repository to download roles and collections (`ansible-galaxy install`). |
| **Vault** | A security feature that encrypts sensitive data like passwords or keys in playbooks. |
| **Tags** | Labels assigned to tasks so you can run specific sections of a playbook. |
| **Delegation** | Running a task on a different host than the target (`delegate_to:`). |
| **Lookup Plugins** | Fetch external data sources during playbook execution. |
| **Filters** | Used to manipulate or format variables and data in templates. |
| **Callbacks** | Customize how output is displayed during playbook execution. |

## üöÄ Execution & Management

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Idempotence** | Ansible ensures that repeating a playbook doesn‚Äôt make further changes if the system is already in the desired state. |
| **Check Mode / Dry Run** | Run playbooks with `--check` to preview changes without applying them. |
| **Become / Privilege Escalation** | Runs tasks as another user (like root) using `become: yes`. |
| **Inventory Plugins** | Extend inventory sources (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP, Azure, dynamic inventories). |
